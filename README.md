## Project Overview

This project focuses on deploying a small language model (Phi-3 mini) onto a Raspberry Pi 5 to facilitate human-building interaction in smart home environments. The primary goal is to enhance control over smart building systems using natural language processing capabilities of the small language model.

### Key Features

- **Deployment of Phi-3 Mini:** Utilizes the Phi-3 mini language model on a Raspberry Pi 5 for efficient and responsive human-building interaction.
- **Smart Building Systems Control:** Integrates with various smart home devices to enable voice-controlled management of building systems such as lighting, temperature, and security.
- **Real-time Interaction:** Provides a seamless interface for users to interact with smart building systems through natural language commands.
