# Small Language Model-Based Smart Home Devices for Human-Building Interaction
## Project Overview
This project focuses on deploying a small language model (Phi-3 mini) onto a Raspberry Pi 5 to facilitate human-building interaction in smart home environments. The primary goal is to enhance control over smart building systems using natural language processing capabilities of the small language model.
Integrates with various smart home devices to enable voice-controlled management of building systems such as lighting, temperature,
