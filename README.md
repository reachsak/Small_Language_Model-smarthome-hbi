# Small Language Model-Based Smart Home Devices for Human-Building Interaction

# Project Overview

This project explores the integration of small language models (SLMs) with smart home environments by deploying the Phi-3 Mini model and Llama 3.2 onto a Raspberry Pi 5 to enable natural language interaction with building systems. The primary objective is to enhance human-building interaction through accessible, cost-effective, and localized AI-powered solutions. This project seeks to revolutionize human-building interaction by embedding generative AI within the built environment. By enabling localized AI-driven decision-making, the research contributes to the development of more responsive, secure, and sustainable smart home ecosystems, forming the backbone for future smart cities.

## Goals and Objectives
- **Human Building Interaction:** Facilitate intuitive voice-controlled management of smart building systems, such as lighting, temperature regulation, and other IoT-connected devices.
- **Edge AI Deployment:** Leverage low-cost single-board computers like the Raspberry Pi 5 to run open-source SLMs locally, eliminating dependency on commercial cloud-based AI services.
- **AI-Driven Decision-Making:** Integrate advanced AI capabilities directly into building infrastructure to support efficient, real-time decision-making.
- **Cost-Effectiveness:** Lower the barrier to entry for AI adoption in smart homes by using open-source tools and affordable hardware.
- **Scalability:** Establish a foundation for scaling edge AI solutions from smart homes to broader smart city initiatives.
## Broader Impacts
- **Smart Building Evolution:** Accelerates the transition toward AI-empowered building systems, fostering smarter, more sustainable infrastructure.
- **Smart City Integration:** Demonstrates a scalable model for applying generative AI to interconnected urban environments, promoting responsive and efficient smart city initiatives.
- **Democratizing AI:** Makes advanced AI solutions accessible to a broader audience by utilizing open-source models and affordable hardware.
